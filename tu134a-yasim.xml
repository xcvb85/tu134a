  <!-- Buck notes:
  
       Approach:
       
         I know the aircraft stalls around 110 knots, but I don't know at what weight, so it's not helpful.
         I increased approach aoa to 4 for an airliner like this.
         Fuel remaining should be much smaller than 0.7, maybe 0.2. It's unlikely that the typical landing configuration has 70% fuel remaining.
         That will affect solved landing weight considerably.
         Removed this: <control-setting axis="/surface-positions/flap-pos-norm" value="0.5"/> Surface positions are not control inputs and shouldn't be used that way.
         They might even create some weird feedback effects. Not good.
         Set flaps to max-down position (1) unless you are very sure this plane does not typically land with full flaps.
         Added control sub-elements for spoilers.

       Cruise:
       
         Throttle should be higher than 0.75 for a max-cruise configuration. I would probably use max throttle if I knew the aircraft's absolute top-end speed,
         but here I'll try using 0.85. Added control sub-elements for spoilers.

  <!-- Buck notes:
         A camber of 0.12 is high for an airliner. Stall aoa of 20 is likely way too high. I'd expect something in the 12 to 18 range, with 18 on the very high end.
         Most airfoils begin stalling around 16 or so, and 20 is getting into the realm of low-aspect delta wings. This value affects YASim lift calculations, so for
         this type of plane I'd guess on the low side, 14 or 15 maybe.

         I couldn't find airfoil data for a Tu-134, but I'll bet the airfoil is similar to that used in the Sud Aviation Caravelle, a slightly older but similar type.
         The Caravelle uses the NACA 65-212 modified. That airfoil has a critical alpha of about 14 degrees, a YASim camber of about 0.06, and a fairly sharp stall drop
         (narrow stall width). So I'd suggest using a camber of 0.06, a stall width of 13 (slightly less than 14 for reasons I explain in my guides), and a width of 4. 

         I'd increase the drag on wing flaps and reduce the lift slighlty. Most flaps are considerably more drag than lift. Something like lift="1.5" drag="2.5"

         I suggest adding some wing twist. Most wings have an aerodynamic twist (wing tip airfoils different from root airfoils). Twist="-2" makes a reasonable guess.

         Dihedral: In a real aircraft an anhedral is typically used to compensate for excessive roll-stability or dutch-rolling. YASim probably won't exhibit the same dutch-roll tendency, so using the true geometric anhedral might result in a more relaxed roll stability than the real plane has. I suggest maybe a slight increase, maybe 0 or 1.

         The control input axis for slats should be "/controls/flight/slats", not a surface position. But I think the Tu-134 doesn't have slats. It's a cheap and easy to maintain design, but not very refined.

  <!-- Buck notes:
  
         Hstab stall aoa should likely be higher than 15, at least 16 or so. In a conventional aircraft, you want the wing to stall before the stabilizer.
         Also, it's common for these designs to have some undercamber on horizontal stabilizers, so I'd suggest camber="-0.06" or a little more.
         That will help give good approach elevator results.
         Lift adjusted to give good approach and still allow AP to function at cruise.
